# imMobilize Hardware Guide 

We aim to make imMobilize a platform that is easily built, adapted and expanded on by anyone. In this hardware section we publish our stl-files, schematics and partnumbers. 

## Cameras and Optics
Each system in equiped with a DMK-UP1300 usb3 camera from [The Imaging Source](http://www.theimagingsource.com), using a MVL75M1 objective on a 25mm extension tube. Each lens is fitted with a longpass filter in a [custom filter holder](https://github.com/DanielDondorp/imMobilize/blob/master/Hardware/STL_files/Illumination/IRFilterholders.stl).

## Electronics
The stimuli hardware and thermometers are driving with an arduino nano microcontroller. 


```python

```
